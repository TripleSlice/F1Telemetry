#### Does it work in multiplayer?
It does! It is not considered "cheating" by the games standards, and you can use it whenever you want. However you may want to check with your league owner if something like this would be allowed in your league
#### The overlay won't display over top of F1?
Make sure you follow [these](##how-to-use?) instructions
#### Will this work for the next game?
It's likely that when the new game comes out, I will update this. You may have to join the Discord in order to poke me to update it though

If I do not update it, you can switch your UDP version of your game to whatever the last version of F1T has been released. The game supports up to 2 years back.
#### How can I tell there is no malicious code?
Short answer, you can't. You can't trust anything, so I don't blame you. Source code is available and you can have a look through it and compile it yourself. Alternatively, run the executable through a couple anti-virus scanners. If the tool gets popular enough I will look into a better method of assuring there is not malicious code other than "Trust me :)"
#### Will there ever be premium features or a paid version?
No. I have no interest in making this paid. Will most likely always be open source. This is a side/passion project, not a business
#### I have an idea for a feature, but I can't code it...
Suggest it on the [issues page](https://github.com/F1Telemetry/F1T/issues "Issues"). There is 0 guarentee that it will ever get looked at or completed, but it is worth a shot
#### Does this work for UNIX/OS X systems?
Not currently
