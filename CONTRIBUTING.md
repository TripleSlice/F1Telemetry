Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests (TBD).
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (TBD).
6. Issue that pull request!
